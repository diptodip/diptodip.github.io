      <description>I&#39;m a computer scientist with a BSCS from Georgia Tech concentrating in theory and intelligence. I am interested in general intelligence for machines and hope to put machine intelligence to the fullest possible use through application to biology. Currently, I am doing research in the Turaga lab at Janelia.
Previously, I was a student researcher at the Paaby lab working on computer vision for quantitative genetics and I gave lectures at The Agency (the Georgia Tech AI/ML club) and Theory Club (the Georgia Tech theoretical CS club).</description>
